  <h2>
    What I was looking for:
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Stealthiness</strong>: Is the client's real IP address sent to the website requested?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Design</strong>: Did it look good? How long did it take me to get to the proxy?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Functionality</strong>: Did the proxy work?
  </p>
